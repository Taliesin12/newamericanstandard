          <h3>What mapping does is make a clear picture of a scene so that we can navigate that scene much more efficiently.  As humans we’ve understood the value of maps and have been creating them for a very long time. And yet there is one map we’ve failed to create. Perhaps now is the time that we create a map of all human knowledge. Currently, this grand topography is recorded only in segmented, scattered bits. <br> <br>	If each concept in human knowledge was given its own address, was defined, and had its relationship to other concepts clearly marked, we’d be creating smooth and efficient pathways for education.

          <h3>At some point all of human knowledge, meaning every subject or branch of learning, should be mapped. We’d begin with mapping the fundamentals of our knowledge—such as the alphabet, colors, and being able to count—until we have mapped more and more complex concepts, ending at the rim of all human knowledge and theory. <br> <br> Every subject of learning would be equally mapped, from mathematics to music, cooking to psychology, finances to martial arts, and so on. Not only would this advance education as a whole, but also imagine how it would advance every individual’s life if they could access such a map.

          <h3>Our life experience hinges so much on our education and our careers. The knowledge map would totally change the ways we approach those areas of life. However, in addition to education and careers, the knowledge map will also enhance our decision making in other areas of life as well—areas we explore in the pursuit of happiness—such as understanding relationships, health, finances, developing talents, discovering new hobbies, and so much more. If our knowledge on all of these subjects was organized all in one place and in an easy to understand fashion, not only would the quality of life drastically improve, but it would also be so much easier to navigate life with intention and with success in achieving desired results.
