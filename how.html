          <button class="collapsible2">Standards Organization </button>
            <div class="content2">
              <p>There are many different possibilities for organization structures. A standards organization makes the most sense because this is exactly what is happening; Creating a standard for Education, companies, and Education techonologies to communicate. </p>

          <button class="collapsible2">Fixed Quality</button>
            <div class="content2">
              <p>Students won’t have any gaps in understanding that fall through the cracks—thus eliminating stress, low confidence, difficulty learning more advanced lessons, and a myriad of other issues later in life that result from educational neglect. Subjective and foggy letter grades will be replaced with clear and precise accomplishment within the curriculum.</p>
            </div>
          <button class="collapsible2">Less homework</button>
            <div class="content2">
              <p>Students, because the education will be customized to each individual, will be taught more efficiently. They will learn more in less time, resulting in less homework—creating a more positive experience for students and their families.</p>

        <div class="buttonbox">
          <button class="collapsible2">Flexible schedule</button>
            <div class="content2">
              <p>Eventually families will no longer have to adjust to a school schedule. Each child’s educational schedule will instead adjust to the scheduling needs of their family. Families will have more time to be together, and this flexibility will greatly benefit families with busy working parents, single parents, children that struggle to adhere to a strict schedule because of medical problems, and so many more. Education will be accessible at any time and at whatever pace the student thrives at most. No more batches of kids in classrooms that meet on a rigid schedule taught at rigid pace. </p>
            </div>
          <button class="collapsible2">Emotional boost</button>
            <div class="content2">
              <p>This method of learning, which encourages a students passion while also giving them a clear map of their past, current, and future education achievements, will boost students confidence and help them to recognize and embrace their valuable potential.</p>
            </div>
          <button class="collapsible2">Their children will get a better education</button>
            <div class="content2">
              <p>The education will be truly custom-made and yet high quality across the board. Socio economic status, living location and school boundaries, or any other factors will no longer disadvantage different groups of students. Children will all have equal opportunity. And because the students get a personalized education, not only will they truly enjoy the journey of learning, but they will be more prepared for life.</p>
            </div>
          <button class="collapsible2">Better Life</button>
            <div class="content2">
              <p>This system will help students find and decide on majors, colleges, and careers with more ease as well as authentic expectations and greater security. They will be better qualified than ever before and will know better how to make good life decisions.</p>
