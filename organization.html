          <h2>This website isn't about "wow look at this cool thing"</h2>
          <h2>It isnt about the educational industry</h2>
          <h2>It is about the Children</h2>
          <h2>It is about improving their lives. </h2>
          <h2>It is education that hasnt fogotten its purpose. To improve lives</h2>
          <h2>To awaken the Joy of learning</h2>
          <h2>One of the greatest crimes is that the education system has taught some people they are dumb and cant learn when in actuality they were just taught poorly</h2>
          <h3>I not aware of ever having met anyone that doesnt like to learn. The Brain is a Hungry organ and wants to learn. It is just what ever they want to learn about. I have met people that think they are dumb and bad at math but are able to instinctually multiply by sixes and sevens because of their love for football. That person was able to talk about historical facts by the multitude. That person understands team dynamics and strategy better than people just out of their MBA. </h3>
          <h3>A young girl that is very social is able to understand communication of human interactions that take a phd to truely define. A Evolutionary Biologist will be able to tell you in great detail about the mating rituals and courtship of some strange exotic animal but not be able to do the same for humans. She is able to tell in fine detail the etiquite and communication of modern day humans as well as the communication of their clothing.</h3>
          <h2>The only difference between some of the  understanding and skills between these and PHD's is the way they communicate. You could say something in the terms of common colloquial language and it isn't as trusted as the same information would be in a thesis. </h2>
          <h2>This is just a transposing of the arrogance of Higher education. It is a new version of the attiude that "only people that speak latin could really qualify as intelligent"</h2>

          <p>When information is cheap it actually allows a new dynamic to be the metric of change. With public domain books it became the book covers. With cooking it became quality and flavor. With education it will be the way in which it is delivered. </p>
