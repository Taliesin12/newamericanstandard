        <h3>Quality</h3>
        <h4>By having quality be constant and time variable students are able to learn at their pace. This is the only way to make sure that no student is left behind. Having a standard quality allows more trust of the institution, the lessons, and the student. </h4>

        <h3>Time</h3>
        <h4>Todays education has time being fixed, but quality variable. This holds bsck more students than it helps. This was a completely fine way to do it when it was instituted but is completely obsolete. By allowing students to learn from lessons specifically chosen for them, the students will learn much faster and save much time. </h4>

        <h4>Modularity is a crucial aspect of personalized education. learning is not a one-size-fits-all situation. defining concepts but not lesson materials allows thousands of ways to teach the same concept. This allow students to get a lesson that fits their skills, understanding, and interests better.  </h4>

        <h4>Because the standard is focused on individual concepts students will not take tests with multiple concepts students and the algorithms will know exactly what the student needs to learn.  </h4>
        <h4>The standard is made to be used gradually more on a quiz type scale and not a standardized test scale. This allows a tight feedback loop.  </h4>
