        <h3>Quality and Time</h3>
        <div class="infobar">
          <h4>Today’s education has time being fixed, while the quality varies. This seems backwards. At the time education was being instituted it was a fine way to do it, but in this era it is obsolete if not very harmful. This structure holds back more students than it helps. <br> <br>By allowing students to learn from tailor-made lesson plans quality will become a constant in each student’s educational experience. Also, having such reliable quality across the board allows more trust and freedom for the institution, the lessons, and the students. <br> <br>By allowing the timing of education to vary and be flexible, students will be able to learn at their pace instead of being rushed or held back. This is the only way to make sure that no student is left behind, and overall this will save time for every student because their time will be used meaningfully. If a student needs a slower or faster pace but is forced to work at an average pace their time is wasted, not to mention what an unenjoyable experience that it is—which creates unhealthy and negative associations with learning. <br> <br> Instead lets produce high quality individualized lessons, that spark a love of learning, while also allowing the students to learn at their optimal pace. This will create an enjoyable experience while also producing better results.

          <h4>Modularity, or the ability to be flexible and rearrangable, is a crucial aspect of personalized education. Learning is not a one-size-fits-all situation. Defining concepts but not lesson materials allows thousands of ways to teach the same concept. This then allows students to get a lesson that fits their learning style, level of understanding, skills, and interests.</h4>
