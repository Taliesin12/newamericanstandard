        <h3>Lessons Taught</h3>
        <h4>Due to the <a href="characteristics.html#modular">modular</a> design of the standard multiple lessons can be used to teach a single concept. This means that the lessons will need to be recorded and their effecacy will need to be compared to the learning profile of the student</h4>
