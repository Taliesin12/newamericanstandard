        <h3>Lessons Taught</h3>
        <h4>Due to the <a href="characteristics.html#modular">modular</a> design of the standard multiple lessons can be used to teach a single concept. This means that the lessons will need to be recorded and their effecacy will need to be compared to the learning profile of the student</h4>

        <h3>Node Learned</h3>

        <h3>Skill Demonstrated</h3>
        <h4>Many computer programs and websites will use the standard to help teach students</h4>
        <h4>Only certain institutions will be given the authority to say that this skill is demonstrated. This is where the quality assurance is made. If there is no trust in this part of the organization, there is no trust in the system. This needs to be air tight. We won't tell how to do the testing so that there is innovation in the methods of having children prove their knowledge and skill. but if universities and companies are going to be able to rely on the whole system this needs to be good.</h4>
        <h4>This is also where the organization earns its money. Free profiles for each student and teacher but for an organization to test your knowledge they need to pay money. Even if it is a small amount, the organization earns a lot of money. If all the 120k k12 schools pay only 1 dollar per day it ends up being 43.8 million a year.</h4>
